# Before and After: Tracker Reset Fix

## Problem Scenario

### Before the Fix

```
User action: Start inference on camera 0
Output: [INFO] Starting inference on camera 0
        [CameraManager] Retrieved pre-opened camera 0
        → Bounding boxes appear correctly ✓

User action: Stop inference
Output: [INFO] Stopped inference on camera 0

User action: Switch to camera 1
Output: [INFO] Camera changed to 1
        [CameraManager] Pre-opening camera 1...

User action: Start inference on camera 1
Output: [INFO] Starting inference on camera 1
        [CameraManager] Retrieved pre-opened camera 1
        WARNING not enough matching points ⚠️
        → NO bounding boxes appear ✗
```

**Problem**: The tracker still has state from camera 0's scene and cannot match objects in camera 1's different scene.

## After the Fix

```
User action: Start inference on camera 0
Output: [INFO] Starting inference on camera 0
        [INFO] Tracker reset for camera 0
        [CameraManager] Retrieved pre-opened camera 0
        → Bounding boxes appear correctly ✓

User action: Stop inference
Output: [INFO] Stopped inference on camera 0

User action: Switch to camera 1
Output: [INFO] Camera changed to 1
        [CameraManager] Pre-opening camera 1...

User action: Start inference on camera 1
Output: [INFO] Starting inference on camera 1
        [INFO] Tracker reset for camera 1
        [CameraManager] Retrieved pre-opened camera 1
        → Bounding boxes appear correctly ✓
```

**Solution**: The tracker is reset before starting inference on each camera, ensuring clean tracking state.

## Technical Comparison

### Before
```python
def inference_thread():
    """Runs YOLO inference in a background thread."""
    global latest_frame, running, current_camera, thread_alive

    thread_alive = True
    print(f"[INFO] Starting inference on camera {current_camera}")

    # Get camera from manager (pre-opened if available)
    cap = camera_manager.get_camera(current_camera)
    # ... tracker state from previous camera still active
```

### After
```python
def inference_thread():
    """Runs YOLO inference in a background thread."""
    global latest_frame, running, current_camera, thread_alive

    thread_alive = True
    print(f"[INFO] Starting inference on camera {current_camera}")

    # Reset tracker state to avoid tracking issues when switching cameras
    try:
        if hasattr(model, 'predictor') and model.predictor is not None:
            if hasattr(model.predictor, 'trackers') and model.predictor.trackers:
                model.predictor.trackers[0].reset()
                print(f"[INFO] Tracker reset for camera {current_camera}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[WARN] Could not reset tracker: {e}")

    # Get camera from manager (pre-opened if available)
    cap = camera_manager.get_camera(current_camera)
    # ... tracker now has clean state for new camera
```

## Key Benefits

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Camera 0 → Camera 0 | ✓ Works | ✓ Works |
| Camera 0 → Camera 1 | ✗ No boxes | ✓ Works |
| Warning messages | ⚠️ "not enough matching points" | ✓ None |
| Tracking consistency | ✗ Broken across cameras | ✓ Clean per camera |
| User experience | ✗ Confusing | ✓ Seamless |
| Code changes | - | 9 lines |

## Root Cause Explained

The YOLO tracker with `persist=True` maintains:
- **Object IDs**: Consistent tracking of the same object across frames
- **Object trajectories**: Where objects have moved
- **Feature matching data**: Visual features used to match objects

When switching cameras:
1. Camera 0 scene: [desk, laptop, person]
2. Tracker learns features of these objects
3. Switch to Camera 1 scene: [window, plant, chair]
4. Tracker tries to match camera 1 objects with camera 0 features
5. **Result**: "WARNING not enough matching points" + no bounding boxes

The fix clears this state so each camera starts fresh.

## Implementation Safety

The implementation includes multiple safety layers:

```python
# Layer 1: Check if predictor exists
if hasattr(model, 'predictor') and model.predictor is not None:
    
    # Layer 2: Check if trackers list exists
    if hasattr(model.predictor, 'trackers') and model.predictor.trackers:
        
        # Layer 3: Try-except around the actual reset
        try:
            model.predictor.trackers[0].reset()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[WARN] Could not reset tracker: {e}")
```

This ensures the code never crashes, even if:
- The predictor hasn't been initialized yet
- The trackers list is empty
- The reset method doesn't exist
- Any other unexpected error occurs
