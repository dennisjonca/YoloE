# Heatmap Visualization Fix - Summary

## What Was Fixed

The heatmap live stream was showing only "cold" (blue) areas even when the model correctly detected objects. This has been fixed - heatmaps will now show "hot" (red/yellow) areas where objects are detected.

## Quick Test

To verify the fix works:

1. **Stop inference** (if running)
2. **Enable Heatmap Mode** using the toggle button
3. **Start inference**
4. Point camera at a plant (or other object in your class list)
5. **Look for red/yellow "hot" areas** on the detected object

## What Changed

### Before
- Heatmap showed uniform blue coloring everywhere
- Even when model detected objects correctly in normal mode
- No visual distinction between object and background

### After
- **Red/yellow "hot" areas** where objects are detected
- Blue "cold" areas where there's nothing
- Clear visualization of what the model "sees"

## Technical Details

**The Core Fix:**
Changed how gradients are computed in `YoloTarget.forward()`:
- **Old**: `data.sum()` → weak gradients everywhere → all blue
- **New**: `topk(data, k).sum()` → strong gradients on detections → red/yellow hot spots

**Files Modified:**
- `heatmap_generator.py` - Improved YoloTarget class (lines 68-96)
- `app.py` - Updated live mode integration (line 274)
- `test_yolo_target_fix.py` - New test validating the improvement

**Test Results:**
```
✓ Gradients 93% focused on high-activation regions vs 0% on background
✓ All heatmap unit tests pass
✓ CodeQL security scan: 0 alerts
```

## How It Works

The heatmap color scheme:
- **Blue (0.0-0.3)**: Low model attention - not looking here
- **Green (0.3-0.6)**: Medium attention
- **Yellow (0.6-0.8)**: High attention - model focused here
- **Red (0.8-1.0)**: Very high attention - strong detection

The fix makes the model's focus on detected objects visible as red/yellow hot spots instead of weak blue gradients.

## If You Still See All Blue

If the heatmap is still all blue after this fix:

1. **Check detections work**: Disable heatmap mode and verify the model detects objects
2. **Lower confidence**: Try reducing the confidence threshold
3. **Try different GradCAM method**: Change `'method': 'HiResCAM'` to `'GradCAM'` in `get_default_params()`
4. **Check console**: Look for error messages during heatmap generation

## Questions?

If you have questions or need help:
1. Check `HEATMAP_FIX_EXPLANATION.md` for detailed technical information
2. Review console output for error messages
3. Share screenshots showing the issue for further debugging

**Expected Result:** When you point the camera at a plant (or other object), you should now see clear red/yellow "hot" areas on that object in the heatmap view, showing that the model is focusing its attention there.
