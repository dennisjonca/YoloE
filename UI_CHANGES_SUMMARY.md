### 3. Video Feed - Performance Overlay

**Overlaid on the video feed (top-left corner):**
```
FPS: 15.3 | Inference: 65.4ms | Detections: 2    [Yellow text]
Conf: 0.25 | IoU: 0.45                            [Yellow text]
```

This overlay appears on every frame, providing real-time feedback about:
- **FPS**: How many frames per second are being processed
- **Inference**: Time taken for each inference cycle
- **Detections**: Number of objects detected in current frame
- **Conf/IoU**: Current detection parameters being used

## User Workflow Examples

### Scenario 1: Objects Not Being Detected

1. User starts inference and sees: `Detections: 0`
2. User checks status: `Hardware: ⚙️ CPU (8 cores)`
3. User sees video overlay: `FPS: 12.3 | Inference: 81.2ms | Detections: 0`
4. User stops inference
5. User goes to "Detection Parameters"
6. User lowers confidence from `0.25` to `0.15`
7. User clicks "Update Parameters"
8. User starts inference again
9. User now sees: `Detections: 3` - objects are being detected!

### Scenario 2: Too Many False Positives

1. User starts inference and sees many incorrect detections
2. User sees: `Detections: 15` but only expects 3-4 objects
3. User stops inference
4. User raises confidence from `0.25` to `0.35`
5. User clicks "Update Parameters"
6. User starts inference again
7. User now sees: `Detections: 4` - much better!

### Scenario 3: Hardware Performance Check

1. User starts inference
2. User sees status: `Hardware: ⚙️ CPU (4 cores)`
3. User sees video overlay: `FPS: 8.2 | Inference: 122.4ms`
4. User checks PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md and learns:
   - FPS < 10 indicates hardware limitation
   - GPU would provide 5-10x improvement
5. User decides to:
   - Use smaller model (YoloE-11s instead of YoloE-11m), OR
   - Consider GPU upgrade for better performance

## Key Benefits

### 1. Transparency
Users can now see exactly what's happening:
- What hardware is being used
- How fast inference is running
- How many objects are being detected
- What parameters are active

### 2. Control
Users can adjust detection sensitivity without editing code:
- Lower confidence for more sensitive detection
- Raise confidence to reduce false positives
- Adjust IoU for overlapping object handling

### 3. Guidance
Built-in tips and comprehensive documentation:
- In-UI parameter recommendations
- PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md for detailed troubleshooting
- Clear indicators of hardware limitations

### 4. Minimal Changes
The implementation is surgical and focused:
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- All new features are additive
- Backward compatible with existing setup

## Technical Implementation

### New Global Variables
```python
current_conf = 0.25  # Configurable confidence threshold
current_iou = 0.45   # Configurable IoU threshold
fps_counter = 0
fps_start_time = time.time()
current_fps = 0.0
inference_time = 0.0
detection_count = 0
```

### New Functions
```python
get_hardware_info()  # Detects CPU/GPU and returns info dict
```

### New Routes
```python
@app.route('/set_parameters', methods=['POST'])
def set_parameters():
    # Validates and updates conf and iou parameters
```

### Modified Functions
```python
inference_thread():
    # Now uses current_conf and current_iou
    # Tracks FPS, inference time, and detection count
    # Adds performance overlay to video frames
```

## Deployment Notes

No additional dependencies required - the changes use existing libraries:
- `torch` - already required by ultralytics
- `cv2.putText()` - already used for drawing labels
- Standard Python libraries for the rest

No configuration changes needed - the new features work out of the box with sensible defaults.
