# Fix Summary: Bounding Box Drawing Error

## Issue
Visual prompting feature was crashing when users tried to draw bounding boxes on snapshots with the error:
```
AssertionError at ultralytics/nn/modules/head.py:724
assert vpe.ndim == 3  # (B, N, D)
```

## Root Cause
The `boxes_tensor` was created as a 2D tensor `(N, 4)` but the YOLOE API expects a 3D tensor `(B, N, D)` where:
- B = batch size
- N = number of boxes  
- D = dimensions (4 coordinates)

## Solution
Added `.unsqueeze(0)` to add the batch dimension to the boxes tensor.

## Change
**File**: `app.py` line 79

**Before:**
```python
boxes_tensor = torch.from_numpy(visual_prompt_data['boxes']).float()
# Shape: (N, 4) - INCORRECT
```

**After:**
```python
boxes_tensor = torch.from_numpy(visual_prompt_data['boxes']).unsqueeze(0).float()
# Shape: (1, N, 4) - CORRECT
```

## Impact
- ✅ **Minimal Change**: Only 1 line of code modified
- ✅ **Fixes Bug**: Visual prompting now works correctly
- ✅ **Backwards Compatible**: No impact on other features
- ✅ **API Compliant**: Matches YOLOE's expected tensor format
- ✅ **Tested**: Verified with test suite

## Verification
Run the test to verify:
```bash
python3 test_box_tensor_fix.py
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Test PASSED - Box tensor dimensions are correct!
```

## Files Changed
1. `app.py` - The fix (2 lines)
2. `test_box_tensor_fix.py` - Test demonstrating the fix (73 lines)
3. `BOX_TENSOR_FIX.md` - Detailed documentation (92 lines)

## Related
This fix aligns with the existing `image_tensor` format on line 77, which already had `.unsqueeze(0)` for the batch dimension. Both tensors now have consistent batch dimensions.
