# Security Summary - Heatmap Generation Feature

## Overview
This document summarizes the security considerations and measures taken for the heatmap generation feature.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Path Validation (Path Injection Prevention)
**Issue**: User-provided file paths could potentially be used to access files outside the intended directory.

**Solution**: Implemented path validation in `/view_heatmap` route:
```python
# Get absolute paths
heatmaps_dir = os.path.abspath('heatmaps')
requested_path = os.path.abspath(path)

# Ensure the requested path is within heatmaps directory
if not requested_path.startswith(heatmaps_dir):
    print(f"[SECURITY] Path traversal attempt blocked: {path}")
    return "Access denied", 403
```

**Protection**: Prevents directory traversal attacks (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`)

### 2. Error Message Sanitization (Information Disclosure Prevention)
**Issue**: Detailed error messages and stack traces could expose internal implementation details.

**Solution**: Generic error messages for users, detailed logging on server:
```python
except Exception as e:
    print(f"[ERROR] Failed to generate heatmap: {e}")
    print(f"[ERROR] Traceback: {traceback.format_exc()}")
    # Don't expose internal error details to user
    return "<html><body><h3>Failed to generate heatmap. Check server logs for details.</h3><a href='/'>Back</a></body></html>"
```

**Protection**: Prevents information leakage that could aid attackers

### 3. Input Validation
**Measures**:
- Model path constructed from fixed prefix + validated model size
- Output paths use timestamp-based naming (no user input)
- File existence checks before operations
- Type checking on parameters

## Pre-existing Security Issues (Not Addressed)

The following security issues were identified by CodeQL but exist in the original codebase and are **not** related to the heatmap feature:

### XSS Vulnerabilities (3 instances)
- Lines 348, 701, 967 in app.py
- User-provided values rendered in HTML without escaping
- **Recommendation**: Implement HTML escaping or use template engine (Jinja2)

### Path Injection Vulnerabilities (8 instances)
- Lines 87, 770, 771, 889, 890, 931, 932, 966 in app.py
- Various model and ONNX file path operations
- **Recommendation**: Validate all user-provided paths against whitelist

**Note**: These pre-existing issues should be addressed separately from this PR as they affect core functionality.

## Threat Model

### Threats Mitigated
✅ Directory traversal via heatmap path  
✅ Information disclosure via error messages  
✅ Arbitrary file access via path manipulation  
✅ Model file injection (paths constructed from validated inputs)  

### Potential Remaining Risks
⚠️ DoS via excessive heatmap generation (rate limiting not implemented)  
⚠️ Disk space exhaustion from heatmap accumulation (cleanup not automated)  
⚠️ Resource exhaustion from large images (size limits not enforced)  

### Mitigation Recommendations
1. **Rate Limiting**: Limit heatmap generation to X per minute per session
2. **Cleanup**: Implement automatic deletion of old heatmaps (e.g., > 7 days)
3. **Size Limits**: Validate snapshot size before heatmap generation
4. **Authentication**: Add user authentication if deploying publicly
5. **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production to protect data in transit

## Testing

### Security Tests Performed
✅ Path traversal attempts blocked  
✅ Error messages don't expose internals  
✅ Only files in heatmaps/ directory accessible  
✅ Invalid paths return 404/403 appropriately  

### CodeQL Analysis
- **Before fixes**: 14 alerts (2 related to heatmap feature)
- **After fixes**: 11 alerts (0 related to heatmap feature)
- **Result**: All new code passes security checks

## Deployment Recommendations

### Development Environment
- Current implementation is safe for development use
- Accessible only on localhost (127.0.0.1)
- No authentication required

### Production Environment
If deploying to production, implement:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   ```python
   from flask_login import login_required
   
   @app.route('/generate_heatmap', methods=['POST'])
   @login_required  # Require authentication
   def generate_heatmap():
       ...
   ```

2. **Rate Limiting**
   ```python
   from flask_limiter import Limiter
   
   limiter = Limiter(app, key_func=get_remote_address)
   
   @app.route('/generate_heatmap', methods=['POST'])
   @limiter.limit("5 per minute")  # Limit requests
   def generate_heatmap():
       ...
   ```

3. **HTTPS Configuration**
   - Use reverse proxy (nginx, Apache)
   - Configure SSL/TLS certificates
   - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

4. **Content Security Policy**
   ```python
   @app.after_request
   def set_csp(response):
       response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = "default-src 'self'"
       return response
   ```

## Compliance

### Privacy Considerations
- Heatmaps contain visual data from camera feed
- May capture identifiable information (faces, license plates)
- **Recommendation**: Add privacy notice and data retention policy

### Data Retention
- Heatmaps stored indefinitely by default
- **Recommendation**: Implement automatic cleanup or user-configurable retention

## Conclusion

The heatmap generation feature has been implemented with security in mind:
- ✅ No new security vulnerabilities introduced
- ✅ Path injection and information disclosure prevented
- ✅ Input validation implemented
- ✅ CodeQL security scan passed

For production deployment, additional security measures (authentication, rate limiting, HTTPS) are strongly recommended.
